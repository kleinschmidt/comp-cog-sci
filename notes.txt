# Half a lecture on computational modeling in cognitive science

Want to keep things at a high level, focus on Bayesian modeling.  Go through some examples/toy problems at the start, then talk about speech perception for as long as I have.

## Overall points to make:

* Bayesian modeling describes how people reason under uncertainty
* Is applied to lots of diferent cognitive and perceptual processes:
    * speech perception
    * depth perception
    * moral reasoning
    * concept learning
    * categorization
    * ...

## Examples

* explaining away. start at conceptual level first, ask people to think through it. then walk through probability distributions
* cue combination: robbie's hand/foot temp example. 
* categorical perception + perceptual magnet effect + maybe belief updating: start w/ speech sound continuum.  speech production/perception is probabilistic.
